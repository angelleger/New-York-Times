    A soft breeze off the Seine did little to calm the nerves of Alexandre Brongniart on a sweltering August day in 1807.  Sweat poured down his cheeks as he ran from one end of the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres to the other, frantically trying to prepare. As the director of this center for French national porcelain just outside Paris, he would have to answer to the judgments of the unexpected visitors who were soon to arrive: The Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, and his famously exacting wife, the Empress Josephine.

    Known across the continent for her taste and French sense of art de vivre, Josephine’s legacy would come to be defined by her demanding standards of excellence. As she descended her carriage, it’s likely that she would be draped in the finest of cashmere shawls from Egypt, Persia or India, a garment she had called “unsightly” before accruing a collection of more than 150 and becoming a trendsetter for the fashion.   
  - |
    On that August day, her husband admonished Brongniart, threatening to close the factory over draftsmanship and color that failed to meet his and his wife’s standards of perfection. Still, the couple continued to peruse through the museum and manufactory, choosing for purchase the opulent goods that had made Sèvres famous: paper-thin porcelain roses, sky-colored potpourri vases in the shape of tall ships, or gilded dinner services.

    It was during the Napoleonic era that cashmere and porcelain would solidify their places as pinnacles of luxury, outlasting the reigns that had popularized them. This isn’t simply due to the opinions of the Bonapartes, however. Instead, each medium is defined by an unparalleled degree of craftsmanship and tradition. Handed down through generations, this artisanship results in beautiful, yet practical goods that both transcend and enhance daily experience, whether it’s the taste of coffee from a porcelain cup or the warmth and comfort of cashmere. 
  - |
    Today, these goods continue to evolve with modern times. Through their heritage they inspire us to ask more of the everyday things we take for granted. These are the ideals behind the Lincoln Continental, which seeks to blend a rich tradition with the cutting-edge technology of contemporary life. By looking to the quality and refinement of these iconic goods, we enjoy a little more of the famous art de vivre.

    While Brongniart and Napoleon may have been instrumental in preserving its post-revolutionary legacy, the establishment of Sèvres porcelain is attributed to Louis XV and his mistress Madame de Pompadour beginning in 1756. During this era, porcelain had become one of the most sought after luxury items among Europe’s nobility and no more so than in the court of Versailles. Influenced by his mistress, who championed the art form, Louis would hold exhibitions of the latest creations of the Sèvres manufactory, compelling his subjects to compete for favor from their king by purchasing the finest pieces.

   Porcelain, and particularly that of Sèvres, became so highly regarded due to its rare, yet contradictory qualities.
  - |
   “At the core of porcelain there is this tension between how fragile it is and how strong it is,” says Sonia Coman, artist, curator and Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University. “Besides being art and having this intrinsic, aesthetic value, it’s also instrumental. They’re utilitarian objects, and as such, they’re always connected to the daily lives of the people who would eventually buy, use or display them.”
  - |
   These unique traits are cultivated through processes that include a variety of techniques. At Sèvres today, 120 craftsmen work in 27 separate specializations. In the first phase, some shape the porcelain on a wheel using their hands or a variety of tools and machinery, while others implement molds, casts or sculpt purely by hand. Seldom is the process the same for two distinct pieces: They may be glazed, painted, burnished or gilded. Between each step the piece is fired, sometimes more than eight separate times at temperatures up to 2,500° Fahrenheit.  
  - |
   “Each stage is quite difficult because you understand it, but you need to feel it, you need to get it,” says Camille Bisson, who, after three years of training, became the first woman to work in Sèvres’ throwing department. Bisson overcame the physical demands of the position, which can include sculpting more than 50 pounds of clay on a wheel, by cultivating her own techniques with the help of her instructor. 
  - |
   It’s essential that each craftsmen be able to execute both the traditional designs of Sèvres as well as current ones, which are often created through collaborations with noted contemporary artists such as Alexander Calder and Louise Bourgeois.
  - |
   This eye toward constant reinvention is something that has defined Sèvres through its long history. 
  - |
   “Sèvres has always been a manufacturer of its time and very open minded to new artistic movements,” says Romane Sarfati, chief executive of Cité de la céramique — Sèvres & Limoges. One way that it is constantly evolving is through color, which now includes over 1,000 varieties. “Each time we have an artist, it’s never enough colors and we have to create a new one. This is very special to Sèvres, really.”
  - |
   But like porcelain itself, there’s a balance between the firm and the ephemeral. Sarfati adds:  “What is permanent is this idea of pieces that are always very well balanced, very pure, the lines are very lignes tendues” — taut lines.
  - |
   Built through a similar tradition of craftsmanship, these qualities are also core to the Lincoln Continental. In much the same way Sèvres continues to reinvent itself, so too has the Continental. Its redesign, which features the bold, sculpted exterior lines the car is known for, also came with a brand new color, Rhapsody in Blue. 
  - |
   “We really had so much rich heritage to draw on but I think this is where we best expressed bringing it into the modern,” says Lincoln Senior Color and Materials Designer Marcia Salzberg. “It’s a solid color. It doesn’t have flakes or metallic. That’s one acknowledgement of the past, because everything these days has a lot of mica and aluminum or glass. So that felt very modern.”
  - |
   Rhapsody in Blue echoes many of Sèvres most iconic pieces, including those of the Neoclassical — favored by Napoleon — and contemporary eras. As Salzberg says, “there’s thoughtfulness behind every color or material decision.”

   Josephine changed her mind about the “unsightly” cashmere shawl her husband sent to her from Egypt for good reason: It saved her life. In December 1800, Josephine was on her way to meet Napoleon at the opera when a bomb exploded. She had stopped to arrange her shawl so it draped properly, otherwise she would have been fatally close to the blast. From then on, Josephine was seldom seen not wrapped in cashmere.  
  - |
   While in accounts the shawl is referred to as a “red Persian shawl,” it’s more likely that it would have been a Kani shawl, originating in the Indian region of Kashmir as part of a tradition that goes back at least six centuries. Handmade through a painstaking process that can take up to a year to make one shawl, these garments carry an important place in Indian tradition and are often gifted at weddings and other special occasions.
  - |
   Today, Ezma, a fine cashmere company headquartered outside New Delhi, is bringing that tradition into the 21st century through state-of-the-art production methods. It’s even reproduced Josephine’s famous shawl.
  - |
   “It’s called ‘the Josephine.’ This design is 400 years old,” says Subhendu Ghosh Dastidar, head of marketing and merchandising at Ezma. “You have design motifs that are as small as half a centimeter. And, to do that eight inch boarder, two workers would take anywhere between four and half to six months.”
  - |
   Ezma, however, is producing shawls that are far finer and softer than the ones Josephine would have known. In part, it achieved this through modern machinery that has allowed it to spin much finer cashmere yarn. In addition, they’ve updated the process of Kani weaving, a traditional craft passed down through generations. It requires that two weavers sit before a loom with up to to 100 small sticks in front of them connected to various colors of yarn. Previously, design guidelines were relayed through song. Ezma has translated that ancient technique to modern design graphs, enabling its weavers to execute new designs.
  - |
   “This cannot go into mass-production. It’s completely bespoke,” says Dastidar. “What we have been trying to do is bring this glory back — what we can achieve through the traditional. But it needs a contemporary twist.”
  - |
   What makes cashmere such a luxury item are its unique properties and the difficulty of collecting it. Combed — not sheared — from the undercoat of cashmere goats, the fiber is fine, absorbs little moisture and has a more rounded shape so it’s less prickly than wool. 
  - |
   Beyond the technical however, cashmere has a psychological significance, according to Ezma founder Sameer Mehra. The same sense of security that Josephine found in cashmere on that night in 1800 continues to be sought after. 
  - |
   “A shawl is a very intimate piece of clothing, it’s like a second skin,” Mehra says. “It’s a utilitarian piece of fabric at the end of the day to protect yourself from that harsh, cold out there. It makes you feel enveloped, protected, cocooned, yet in the most luxurious way.”
  - |
   It’s this philosophy and approach that’s guided the design of the Lincoln Continental’s interior. 
  - |   
   “Warmth and security is the objective of our entire environment,” Salzberg says. “Because a car is a very functional product, and it needs to be not only aesthetically beautiful, it has to be visually and texturally pleasing. It very much surrounds you, encapsulates you. I think it gives you a sense of security, quality, uniqueness.”
  - |   
   To achieve the effect, Lincoln takes a global approach to sourcing its materials, such as its aniline leather, which all undergo rigorous rounds of testing. In the same way that Ezma’s weavers zero into just a single line of thread on a shawl, each interior stitch is carefully and purposefully designed down to the square inch.
  - |
   For Salzberg, the parallels between porcelain, cashmere and the Lincoln Continental can’t be missed.
  - |
   “They all symbolize luxury, sophistication, refinement, modern design and simplicity, exclusive and desired. They all involve color, scale, proportion,” he says. “All three reflect one’s lifestyle, self-expression, personality and self-image. All are investments in themselves, and their future.”
